Lambda Expression

Advantages 
 
 1) Enables Functional Programming
 2) Readable and concise code
 3) Easier to use APIs and  Libraries
 4) Enables Support for Parallel processing
 
 
 stringFunction = ()-> System.out.println("Hello world");
 intFunction =(int a,int b)-> a+b;
 StringLengthFunction = (String message) ->{
 return message.length();
 };

 An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as a functional interface.
It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method. It can also declare methods of the object class.
